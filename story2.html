 <center><h1>The fox ad the grapes</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time in a far far land, there was a <mark>fox</mark>.</p>
    <p>one day when the fox was roaming in the forest, it saw a bunch of <u>grapes!</u></p>
    <div id="d1"><img src="fox1.png" alt=""></div>
    <p>so right away, the fox jumped to the grapes in a tree branch.</p>
    <p>but the branch was to high and then he also <del>missed the grapes.</del></p>
    <div id="d2"><img src="fox2.png" alt=""></div>
    <p>so then he tried again and again but he missed.</p>
    <p>what kept him going was the thought that these might be <i>the best grapes in the world</i>.</p>
    <div id="d3"><img src="fox3.png" alt=""></div>
    <p>so then he walked of a short distance. then he ran and leapt forwad.</p>
    <p>but alas! he could not reach it.</p>
    <p>he kept triyng and trying. but he could not reach it.</p>
    <div id="d4"><img src="fox4.png" alt=""></div>
    <p>so then the fox finally gave up. he said: <big>what a fool am I!</big></p>
    <p>wearing myself out for a bunch of grapes! <strong>these could not even be the best grapes</strong>.</p>
    <p>this could be so sour grapes maybe. Away he walked very scornfully.</p>
    <div id="d5"><img src="fox5.png" alt=""></div>
    <h1>Moral of the story:</h1>
    <p>many people <mark>despise</mark> what is beyond their reach.</p>
